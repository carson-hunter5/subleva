# Subleva Project Repo for DoC 2024 

## About

This is our project repository for Subleva: A Migration analytics app for our final project developed for the Summer 2024 DoC in Leuven, Belgium titled Data and Software in International Government and Politics.

Currently, there are three major components:
- Streamlit App (in the `./app` directory)
- Flask REST api (in the `./api` directory)
- MySQL setup files (in the `./database` directory)

This project consisted of work and collaboration from Carson Hunter, Ivionna Jordan, and Dylan Sacks.
