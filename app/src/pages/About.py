    Migration is a natural byproduct of human society and remains a highly 
    important topic for governments, politicians, and citizens alike. Often 
    polarizing, this topic can evoke a wide range of emotions. Subleva aims 
    to mitigate this contention by providing a quantitative approach to understanding
    migration from both persectives and offers resources for migrants. Our app focuses
    on visualizing and predicting migration patterns,to offer stakeholders a data-driven
    perspective on refugees and refugee stories.
